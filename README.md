# LSTM_Message_Classification

I used an LSTM model to predict the next word in a sequence. I implemented the tokenizer from TensorFlow to process the text data, ensuring that it was cleaned and preprocessed. The input data was embedded to create meaningful representations of the words. I then generated sequences, which were converted into arrays for model input. After preparing the data, I compiled the model and utilized pipeline inference to streamline the prediction process, achieving efficient and accurate results in word-level text prediction.
